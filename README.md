# ITM To GPX

**[Download here](https://github.com/Eusebius1920/itmtogpx/releases)**

## Converts any *.itm file of GPS Photo Tagger to a *.gpx file.

With processing multiple files at the same time it makes exporting out of **GPS Photo Tagger** much easier. You can use the .gpx file for other programs supporting gpx.

Not supported are: Pictures. Only the gps data will be exported (If you use a gps tracker like Travel Honey etc)
